### 문제 설명

<p>Farmer John has N cows that need to be milked (1 <= N <= 10,000), each of which takes only one unit of time to milk.</p><p>Being impatient animals, some cows will refuse to be milked if Farmer John waits too long to milk them.  More specifically, cow i produces g_i gallons of milk (1 <= g_i <= 1000), but only if she is milked before a deadline at time d_i (1 <= d_i <= 10,000).  Time starts at t=0, so at most x total cows can be milked prior to a deadline at time t=x.</p><p>Please help Farmer John determine the maximum amount of milk that he can obtain if he milks the cows optimally.</p>
